Good work here!

I like the way that your getMaxIndex() method calls getMax().  Good re-use of code!

You squeezed a lot of logic into the line
  while (!(n = keyboard.nextLine()).isEmpty()) 

I assume you understand exactly what it's doing, or you wouldn't have used it :-)
So you know, the more common version was
  s = keyboard.nextLine();
  while (s.length > 0)
  {
    addItem(s);
    s = keyboard.nextLine();
  }
  
It does exactly the same thing as yours.  More code, but easier to follow. 
  There are always trade-offs!
  
Good work overall.
